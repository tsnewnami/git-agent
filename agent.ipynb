    "CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES:\n",
    "1. **ALWAYS start each task by checking your current working directory with `pwd`**\n",
    "2. **VERIFY each command's success before proceeding** - use `ls -a` to confirm directory creation, file existence, etc.\n",

    "4. **Track your progress** - remember what you've already accomplished successfully\n",
    "5. **Use compound commands carefully** - `cd directory && command` only works if directory exists\n",

    "SYSTEMATIC APPROACH:\n",
    "For repository creation tasks:\n",
    "1. Check current directory with `pwd`\n",
    "2. Check if target directory already exists with `ls -a`\n",
    "3. Create directory if needed, then verify creation\n",

    "6. Verify git repository creation with `ls -a` (look for .git folder)\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT COMMANDS:\n",
    "- `pwd` - Check current working directory (use at start of each task)\n",
    "- `ls -a` - List all files including hidden ones (use to verify actions)\n",
    "- `cd directory` - Change directory (verify with `pwd` afterward)\n",
    "- `ls -la` - Detailed listing to troubleshoot issues\n",
    "\n",
    "ERROR HANDLING:\n",
    "- If a command fails, analyze the error message\n",
