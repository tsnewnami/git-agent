    "1. Check current directory with `pwd`\n",

    "- `pwd` - Check current working directory (use at start of each task)\n",
    "- `ls -a` - List all files including hidden ones (use to verify actions)\n",
    "- `cd directory` - Change directory (verify with `pwd` afterward)\n",
    "- `ls -la` - Detailed listing to troubleshoot issues\n",

    "- If a command fails, analyze the error message\n",
